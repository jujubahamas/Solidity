# Solidity library

Excuse me Filip to take your Solidity code as a fork. I'm learning how to produce a commit at GitHub
for that, I picked your code as an example. I will check if I can actually do any constructive modifications 
next step I learning how to do a "pull request". It will be my first pull request ever.

Many thanks. 

Please let me know if there are any licenses that I need to refer to once I fork your code.
