# Solidity library

Excuse me Filip to take your Solidity code as a fork. I'm learning how to produce a commit at GitHub
In order to do that, I picked your code as an example. I will check if I can actually do any constructive modifications to it. 

Next step for me, is learning how to do a "pull request". It will be my first pull request ever.

The academy.ivanontech.com is an amazing Programming course. I learned a lot from you and everybody should give it a chance.

Please let me know if there are any licenses that I need to refer to once I fork your code.

Tak s√• mycket !
